# MTA Data Visualizer Compose App

This is an app for visualizing MTA subway ridership on the web, built in Kotlin Multiplatform.

## Running

You can open the web application by running the `:composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun` Gradle
task.

## Structure

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code that’s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.
